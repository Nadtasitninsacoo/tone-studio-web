/**
 * MonitorHandover — the live sound moves when you press this, and at no other time.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * This **replaces** the rule that the page on screen owns the live monitor, and the
 * reasoning for the replacement is worth keeping because the old rule was not wrong.
 *
 * Ownership had to become explicit for two reasons, both of them about the player rather
 * than the audio thread:
 *
 * - **Navigating is not a request to change the sound.** Opening the mixer to look at a
 *   fader silenced the rack you were in the middle of dialling. Coming back re-opened it,
 *   so nothing was lost in the data — but a monitor that cuts out because you glanced at
 *   another page is indistinguishable, in the moment, from one that broke.
 * - **A tone is dialled by ear over minutes.** The settings were always safe in
 *   `lib/ampStore.ts`, but the *ear* is the working state, and it was being reset by a
 *   click on a nav item. That is what "ค่าหาย" meant: not the numbers, the take.
 *
 * What the old rule was protecting is still protected, and by the same mechanism: exactly
 * one side is audible at a time. Two engines running rig chains on one input is double the
 * convolvers and worklets, and three live channels was once enough to overrun the audio
 * thread. Nothing here loosens that — it only moves the decision from the router to a
 * button.
 *
 * The feedback argument survives too, and is if anything stronger. Nothing opens a monitor
 * without a press now, including on `/`, where you arm the input and decide whether the
 * room is safe to open a speaker into.
 *
 * **The wording is "สลับมาฟัง", not "รับเสียงมา", and that was a correction.** The first
 * label read as taking something off the other page, and it was reported three times as the
 * button stealing the sound. It is not taking anything: both sides carry the same signal
 * through the same racks, and this moves where you are listening from — one end of a cable
 * to the other. What is exclusive is the *listening*, and nothing is lost by it, because
 * hearing both at once would be the same instrument through two copies of the same
 * processing on two clocks: double the CPU and a comb filter for the trouble.
 *
 * `useSyncExternalStore` needs its third argument here like everywhere else in this app —
 * every route is prerendered, and without a server snapshot `next build` fails on the page
 * with "Missing getServerSnapshot" rather than degrading to client rendering.
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
