/**
 * RigDeskLink — the bridge between this row of six and the desk's faders.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Off, the two are separate jobs: the level here is what you hear *while dialling a tone*,
 * and the desk's fader is where that instrument sits *in the mix*. Only one side owns the
 * live monitor at a time, so the two numbers are never both applied — which is what lets
 * them be independent without ever disagreeing.
 *
 * They were wired together unconditionally at first, and it broke the obvious way to work:
 * shape a tone here, balance it on the desk, come back for one more tweak — and the balance
 * is gone, overwritten by a slider that only ever meant to set a monitor level.
 *
 * On, that same wiring is genuinely useful, which is why this is a switch rather than a
 * deletion: six faders that move the whole desk at once is the fastest way to rough out a
 * balance before touching a single strip.
 *
 * **It also lets both engines sound at once**, which is the thing it was actually being
 * asked for. Off, listening is exclusive and the handover button moves it; on, the Rig
 * page's monitor and the desk are both live. That is twice the DSP — the cost this whole
 * project spent a day learning — and any instrument live on both sides is heard through two
 * copies of the same processing on two clocks, which comb-filters because two buffers can
 * never be in phase. Both are real, both are the player's to manage by switching a channel
 * off on one side, and neither is a reason to refuse the mode.
 *
 * **The faders link both ways**, and getting there took a correction. It ran Rig → desk
 * only, on the reasoning that a rack can sit on several strips so "which fader sets it"
 * had no answer. With both engines audible that made a desk fader control half of what
 * could be heard — pulled to the bottom, the Rig monitor carried on playing that
 * instrument at full, which reads as a fader that does not work. The question does have an
 * answer: **the fader that was just moved.** Two strips carrying one rack now behave like
 * two faders on one bus, last touch wins.
